## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
### Image Processing
* **Image Manipulation Detection (School-level Scientific Research Project)** 11/2019~Now
  * RGB features are not always the best source for extracting tampered features because it contains much more continuous information
  than discrete information. However, sometimes discrete information is more significant for detecting manipulations.
  * Based on two-stream Faster R-CNN, we proposed a bit recombined network to adaptively balance the proportion of these two
  portions through learning features from bit planes of each image.
  * Validating on NIST16 dataset, our method performs better on F1 score (improved from 0.722 to 0.928) than state-of-the-art methods.
  On Columbia dataset, it performs better on AUC (improved from 0.858 to 0.914). On COVER dataset, it performs better both on F1
  score (improved from 0.437 to 0.492) and AUC (improved from 0.817 to 0.826).

* **Research of Face Anti-spoofing based on Multi-layer Domain Adaptation** 03/2019~08/2019

  **Achievement:** The paper of ***Face Anti-spoofing based on Multi-layer Domain Adaptation*** was accepted by ***IEEE International
Conference on Multimedia & Expo*** on August 2019.
  * Face anti-spoofing detection attracts extensive attention and many methods been proposed. However, these methods perform poorly
  in cross scenes.
  * We proposed a face anti-spoofing detection algorithm based on domain adaptation to solve this problem. To further improve the
  performance, we fused low-level features with high-level features of convolutional neural network for face anti-spoofing detection.
  * Validating on Replay-Attack Database, our method has the lowest EER (reduced from 0.4 to 0.3) and HTER (reduced from 0.8 to
  0.6). Evaluation on cross scenes, when the model is trained on Replay-Attack Database and tested on CASIA Face Anti-Spoofing
  Database, our method has the best HTER (reduced from 0.354 to 0.343).

### Bio-Image Processing
* **Correction Algorithm Design of Ring Artifacts Based on Energy Spectrum Detector** 11/2018~08/2019
  
  **Achievement:** Chinese Patent ***NO.201910356591.9*** issued at Apr. 2020
  * CT reconstruction technology has been widely applied in the field of medical radiological diagnosis while ring artifact is the main
  problem unfavorably influenced the quality of reconstructed images. However, there are some flaws in current correction algorithms,
  such as incomplete artifact correction and image distortion.
  * Aiming to the fan-beam filtering back-projection algorithm, we proposed a multi-region segmentation algorithm for ring artifact
  correction to fix reconstructed images.
  * Reconstructed images corrected by our method performs ±0.584~±0.741 on Image Uniformity (≤ ±3 stipulated by China National
  Standard) and ±0.0006%~±0.0056% on Local Noise Analysis (≤ ±0.35% stipulated by China National Standard).
